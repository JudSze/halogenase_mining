## Question fed to Claude:

I want to make a two page website. Both pages should be connected to a postgresql database. The main page of the website shows the main table that contains a gene_name column. When clicking on a field in the gene_name column on the website, a user is navigated to the page where the table that belongs to that gene is shown. What is the logic behind the website, what are the main steps of creating this website using Python and what packages should I use?
